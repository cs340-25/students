Hi my name is Minh Cao (pronounced just like this building), and I am currently a Junior majoring in CS planning on Graduating in Spring of 2026. I am hoping for my project in this class to be a Student database registry for my youth group to use. The idea is to build a program where it makes it easier to sign up and reresign for the next year easier as well. I want to be able to make it so each student gets a student ID and be able to access their information and each gets a login.
